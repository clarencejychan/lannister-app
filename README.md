# Lannister

Lannister allows anyone to keep track and analyze the distribution of their holdings both in crypto and fiat (banks, deposits, savings, etc).

Note: This is the repository containing the web version. **This is still a work in progress.** If you're looking for the production ready iOS application it's available at [here](https://github.com/lannister-capital/lannister-ios).
